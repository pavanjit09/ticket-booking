# ticket-booking
This program allows users to book, view, and cancel tickets for an event. It's a text-based system with a menu interface that can be run in a terminal or command prompt.
~~ How the Program Works:
1.Book a Ticket: Users can book a ticket by providing their name and a desired seat number. The program checks for availability and confirms the booking.
2.View Booked Tickets: Displays all booked tickets with seat numbers and the names of the users.
3.Cancel a Ticket: Users can cancel a booking by providing the seat number. The program removes the booking from the system.
4.Exit: Exits the program.
